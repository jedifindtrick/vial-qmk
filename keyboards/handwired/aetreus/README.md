# Ätreus
> A compact variant of the [Atreus](https://gitlab.com/technomancy/atreus) for people who can't live without the letters `å` and `ä`.

## Layout
The Atreus layout, but:

- Add the pinky-keys `Tab, Esc (Caps Lock), Å and Ä`.
- Remove some bottom row keys that are awkward to reach anyways.

## Design
This keyboard is built to be portable, slim, and placed inside a laptop.

- Built for low-profile switches, to create a thin keyboard.
- Plate-less and case-less (inspired by the [Gergo](https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergo)), once again to minimize keyboard height. The plan is to glue a thin mousepad underneath to ensure stability, limited flex, and nice placement inside a laptop.
- Bluetooth support, in order to make it fast to pull out and place in your laptop without messing with cables.
